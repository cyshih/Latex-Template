The repo contains the following latex templates that I find helpful:
(1) Latex template for problem sets in math/science/engineering
(2) Latex template when you want your document to have a table of content that links you to each section

Acknowledgement: inventor of latex and the world wide web (these two templatex are both partially taken from templates I came across on the web but I don't remember where exactly).
